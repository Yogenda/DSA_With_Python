Introduction

What is Data Structure?
different ways of organizing data on your computer that can be used efficiently.

from s/w point of view DS is important becaues
- efficiency
- performance
s/w is dependent on how you are storing and organizing the data

real life examples
- people standing in queue for new phone launch
- whiting for there order
- organizing books in shelf

What is algorithm?
    set of instruction to perform a task.

real life examples
    - ATM withdrawal
    - construct wall
    - making a tea
    - order a food from zomato

algorithm
    - Input
    - Calcuation / Process
    - Output / stop when you get your answer

What makes a good algo?
    - Correctness 
    - Efficient


Why DSA is important?

- Input: m,t,w,t,f,s,s, 20,45,30,25,34,43,39
- Process: Arrange, maerge, sort, maths operatinos.......
- Output: m - 20, t - 45, w-30........
our main responsiblitiy is to perform the action on data in Process section.


Google map:
- input: source and destination
- Process: 
- Ouput: provide the shortes and Efficient path


Why companies are asking DSA questions
- to check the fundamental of programming
- Problem solving skills
- limited time to judge

Different type of Data Structure
    - Primitive: not able to break down into sub data types or data structures
    - Non primitive: can broken down into sub data type or data structure based on our requirement.

Primitive:
    - fix size
    - simple
    - simple operations

Non Primitive:
    - larger in size and are flexible (we can grow or shrink the size)
    - complex (collection of many primitive data structures).
    - more complex operations (sorting, searching, data manipulation.....)


Primitive:
    - Integer
    - Float
    - String
    - Boolean

Non Primitive:
    - Linear: when the elements are in squential order (we have to define the order of an element).
        - List
        - Tuple
        - Arrays
        - Linked List
        - Stack
        - Queue
    - Non Linear: when the elements are not arranged in a sequntial order
        - Set
        - Dictionary
        - Tree
        - Graph


Type of algorithms:
    - Sorting algorithm
    - Searching algorithm
    - Graph algorithm
    - Dynamic Programming algorithm
    - Divide and conqueror algorithm
    - Recursive algorithm
